My name is Durgesh, a CSM Student at SISTK in my 2nd year. I am a Web Developer intern and have already completed 2 internships on web development. I know the languages HTML, CSS, and JS, and I am currently learning Python. As a CSM student, I am very much interested in AI and want to work on Big Language Models using AI and ML algorithms.

I am a passionate learner and I am always looking for new challenges. I am also a team player and I am always willing to help others. I am confident that I can make a valuable contribution to your team.
